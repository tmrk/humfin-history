# Humanitarian Finance History

This page displays a line chart showing how much funds (in Swiss Franc) have been used for humanitarian response since 1919, adjusted for inflation.

Although only one data source is used (i.e. the appeals data exposed by the [IFRCGo API](https://goadmin.ifrc.org/docs/#api-v2-appeal-list)), it is still indicative of historical trends given the Red Cross Movement's long-standing presence in humanitarian reponse, and this is the only currently available dataset dating all the way back to the aftermath of World War I. 

(For modern datasets that include much more aspects of aid funding, see the 
[International Aid Transparency Initiative](https://github.com/IATI).)

To adjust for inflation, the CPI data published by the [Federal Statistical Office of Switzerland](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/asset/de/cc-d-05.02.08) is used.
